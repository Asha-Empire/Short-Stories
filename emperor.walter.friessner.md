Despite his love for adventure, Walter was also an excellent student. He was particularly gifted in science and technology, and he excelled in his studies. His teachers and parents recognized his potential, and they encouraged him to pursue a career in those fields.

However, Walter's ambitions extended beyond the bounds of Novus. He was fascinated by the universe beyond his home planet and was eager to explore it for himself. So, after completing his education, he joined the local army of **Novus** and began serving in the navy.

Under his rule, the Asha Empire flourished. Walter encouraged scientific and technological progress, and the empire's territories expanded as new star systems were explored and colonized. He was beloved by the people, who saw him as a benevolent and just ruler.

At the end of his life, Walter was succeeded by his daughter **Naina**, who continued her father's legacy by expanding the empire and consolidating its power. Under Naina's rule, the Asha Empire became an even more formidable force, and her reputation as a capable and just leader helped to solidify her father's legacy.
